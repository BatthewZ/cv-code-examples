# WELCOME TO MY CV

Here is a brief description of each of these projects:

### Ebus Tool (WIP)

A project for the University of New South Wales, working with Katelyn Purnell to develop her tool for estimating energy requirements of electric vehicles for public transport in Australia (Read more here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118272). The project will be open source, but for the moment I do not have permission to share the full project publically. But, here is part of the UI and the interfacing server. This UI has limited repsonsivity, as it is only ever intended to be run locally on computers, and never on tablets/phones. Some of the calculations that the full app performs can take hours due to large data sets.
