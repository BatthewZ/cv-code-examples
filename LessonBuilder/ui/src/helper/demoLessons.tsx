      description:
        "The easiest way to identify common upper exensions is to play a seventh chord in root position in your left hand, then a triad with the same tonality off the 'two' (or 'nine') an octave in your right hand. \n\nFor example, here we have C major 7 in the left hand, then a D major triad in the right hand. 'D' is the two or nine of 'C', and because we've got a 'C Major' chord underneath, we make our 'D' chord minor as well. \n\nSide Note: This technically spells out Cma13#11 in root position.\n\nBut, the more important thing to see here, is that we can use the right hand notes (D, F#, A) as upper extensions to our chord as we start to create our voicing.",

        "We're going to construct our chord from the bottom up.  Typically, the lower in pitch our chord is, the wider our intervals should be. The higher we go, the more that we can smoosh our intervals together.  \n\nBut, it's often nice to hear clarity of the chord by having the top note a small-ish step away from the rest. Here's an example of what a voicing might look like. But let's build one together in the next step! ",
